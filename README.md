# Rosely Light - a Visual Studio Code theme
## A low contrast soothing colour palette based on millennial pink

The Rosely Visual Studio Code Theme is based on a millennial pink inspired
colour palette.

It is a deliberately low contrast theme full of soothing
contemporary colours designed to induce calmness and serenity and works well
even on lower contrast displays. It is not eye fatiguing as it avoids high
contrast colour changes and helps the eyes to focus on what is important.

It is part of the overall Rosely Design System created by
[Chris Tham](chris.tham@hellotham.com).
